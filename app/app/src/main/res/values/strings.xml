    <string name="terms_and_conditions">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.\n        \n\nThe app\'\s source code is open source - and will be available soon on Github, for any legal use. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Moonface.\n        \n\nMoonface is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app, at any time and for any reason.\n        \n\nThe MoonHome app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide the service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.\n        \n\nYou should be aware that there are certain things that Moonface will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Moonface cannot take responsibility for the app not working if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.\n        \nIf you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n        \n\nWhen you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Moonface accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.\n        \nAt some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system  may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Moonface does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.\n        \n\nWe may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us.</string>
